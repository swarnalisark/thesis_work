# FORT's website

This directory contains the source files of FORT's site and documentation.

Github automatically compiles and publishes it at [https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/](https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/).

You can also compile the documentation yourself by installing the required plugins and running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) from this directory.

```bash
$ sudo gem install jekyll-seo-tag jekyll-sitemap
$ jekyll build
```

Have a look at your generated files in the new `_site/` directory. (Start at `index.html`.)
